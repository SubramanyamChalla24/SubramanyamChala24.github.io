Hey there, I am Subramanyam Challa. Currently pursuing a Master's in Robotics and Autonomous Systems in Artificial Intelligence. 
I have finished my Integrated Master's of Technology from University of Hyderabad. 

In my recent professional journey, I have combined my skills in AI and machine learning to develop impactful and innovative solutions. At Infiheal, I played a pivotal role in enhancing emotional analysis capabilities for a mental health chat-bot, leveraging advanced web scraping and machine learning techniques. My efforts led to significant improvements in data classification accuracy and development efficiencies.

My research has been focused on optimizing machine learning in distributed systems, resulting in reduced development times and enhanced data processing capabilities on large-scale clusters. This work culminated in a comprehensive thesis. 

Currently, I'm working on novel projects in autonomous vehicle technology and persuasive ad generation using reinforcement learning and advanced AI models as part of course projects.
