        - Development of ML models to analyse user emotion and intent in a mental health chat-bot
        - Collaborated with cross-functional teams using Python and BeautifulSoup to pioneer advanced web scraping methods for Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube, culminating in a dataset of over 150,000 samples.
        - Optimized machine learning model training by integrating LSTM and RNN architectures, resulting in an impressive 60% data classification accuracy and significantly reducing manual labeling efforts for data preparation.
        - Implemented NLU techniques with BERT, RoBERTa, and BigBird models to develop models for mental health chat-bot and deploying them on AWS, resulting in a notable accuracy boost from 60% to 90% for intent classification.
        - Demonstrated expertise in developing Python code-bases with a focus on reproducibility and ease-of-use for newcomers,accompanied by comprehensive documentation, resulting in a 25% reduction in development time
